# PRiority — Product Requirements Document v2.0
*Zero-friction GitHub issue funding with AI-powered estimation and execution*

## Executive Summary

PRiority transforms GitHub issue management by introducing market-driven prioritization through seamless, repo-owned funding rails. Built entirely on GitHub Actions with no external infrastructure, it enables maintainers to sustainably monetize their work while giving stakeholders a direct path to accelerate critical features and fixes.

## 🎯 Product Vision

### One-Liner
**Pay to prioritize. Estimate with AI. Ship with confidence.**

### Core Promise
Funding creates priority signals, not delivery guarantees. Every dollar accelerates work while respecting maintainer autonomy.

### Key Differentiators
- **Zero Infrastructure**: Runs entirely on GitHub Actions—no servers, no external accounts
- **Repo-Owned**: Payment credentials stay in repository secrets, maintainers control everything
- **AI-Native**: Claude-powered estimation and optional autonomous execution
- **Learning System**: Estimates improve with every completed issue using historical data
- **Transparent**: All transactions recorded in-repo, fully auditable

## 📊 Market Analysis

### The Open Source Sustainability Crisis

**Market Size & Growth**
- 90% of companies use open source, yet only 0.02% of users contribute financially
- GitHub hosts 330M+ repositories with 100M+ developers
- Open source contribution gap costs enterprises $8.8 trillion in unpaid labor
- Developer time valued at $100-200/hour, yet most maintainers work for free

**Failed Solutions**
- **BountySource**: Shut down in 2023, leaving $2M in limbo
- **IssueHunt**: Requires external accounts, <1% adoption rate
- **Gitcoin**: Complex crypto mechanics, high friction
- **GitHub Sponsors**: Monthly subscriptions, no issue-level granularity
- **OpenCollective**: Organization-focused, not issue-specific

### Maintainer Pain Points

1. **Issue Overload Syndrome**
   - Average popular repo: 50+ open issues, 10+ new weekly
   - 67% of maintainers report burnout from issue triage
   - No clear signal for what community actually values
   - Time spent on "nice-to-have" while critical issues languish

2. **Monetization Friction**
   - Setting up payment infrastructure takes days/weeks
   - External platforms require separate accounts and onboarding
   - No direct connection between specific work and compensation
   - Transaction fees eat 5-30% of contributions

3. **Estimation Paralysis**
   - Software estimation accuracy typically 30-70% off
   - No data on similar past issues to reference
   - AI assistance costs unknown and unbounded
   - Fear of over/under-promising leads to no estimates

4. **Execution Uncertainty**
   - Context switching between paid and unpaid work
   - No clear workflow for funded vs unfunded issues
   - Manual tracking of work done vs funded amount
   - Refund complexity when work incomplete

### Stakeholder Needs

**Enterprises**
- Accelerate critical bug fixes without hiring
- Transparent spending for finance/procurement
- Audit trail for compliance
- SLA-like prioritization without contracts

**Individual Contributors**
- Get their PR reviewed/merged faster
- Support projects they depend on
- Tax-deductible contributions (via 501c3 fiscal hosts)
- See direct impact of their funding

**Maintainers**
- Sustainable income stream
- Maintain autonomy and control
- Minimal overhead and administration
- Clear signals on community priorities

## 💡 Core Features

### 1. Intelligent Estimation Engine

**Multi-Signal Analysis**
```typescript
interface EstimationSignals {
  // Historical patterns
  similarIssues: IssueSimilarity[]      // Cosine similarity > 0.7
  authorHistory: PastContributions[]     // Author's merged PRs
  fileComplexity: FileMetrics[]          // Cyclomatic complexity, churn
  
  // Code intelligence  
  dependencies: DependencyGraph          // Affected modules
  testCoverage: CoverageReport          // Existing test percentage
  breakingChanges: APIAnalysis         // Public API modifications
  
  // AI analysis
  claudeAssessment: ComplexityScore    // LLM-based evaluation
  implementation_plan: StepBreakdown   // Detailed task decomposition
}
```

**Confidence-Based Estimates**
```yaml
Estimation Output:
  effort_hours: 
    p10: 4     # Best case (10th percentile)
    p50: 8     # Most likely (median)
    p90: 16    # Worst case (90th percentile)
  
  token_budget:
    base: 1_200_000
    buffer: 400_000  # 33% safety margin
  
  confidence: 72%    # Based on historical accuracy
  
  breakdown:
    - "Update API endpoints (2-4h)"
    - "Modify database schema (1-2h)"  
    - "Update tests (2-4h)"
    - "Documentation (1-2h)"
```

**Learning Feedback Loop**
- Track estimated vs actual (hours, tokens, complexity)
- Update repo-specific priors after each completion
- Share anonymized learnings across repos (opt-in)
- Achieve <25% MAPE after 20 completions

### 2. Frictionless Payment Rails

**Provider Abstraction Layer**
```javascript
// Single interface, multiple providers
const payment = await createPaymentLink({
  provider: repo.config.preferred_provider,
  amount: estimate.suggested_funding,
  metadata: {
    repo: context.repo,
    issue: context.issue.number,
    estimateId: estimate.id
  }
});

// Returns provider-agnostic link
// User never leaves GitHub
```

**Smart Payment Routing**
1. Check repo preferred provider
2. Fall back to organization default
3. Offer all available options
4. Track success rates per provider

**Instant Verification**
```yaml
# User comments after payment
/confirm stripe pi_29C3x4... amount=500

# Action verifies in <3 seconds:
✓ Payment verified with Stripe
✓ Amount: $500.00 USD
✓ Status: Paid (Gold tier 🏆)
✓ Token budget: 2.4M tokens
✓ Work commencing...
```

### 3. Autonomous Agent Execution

**Claude-Powered Implementation**
```yaml
Agent Capabilities:
  - Read issue requirements
  - Analyze codebase structure
  - Generate implementation plan
  - Write code with tests
  - Run test suites
  - Open pull requests
  - Respond to review comments
  
Safety Controls:
  - Token budget enforcement
  - Sandboxed execution
  - No force push permitted
  - Human review required for merge
  - Automatic rollback on test failure
```

**Progressive Automation Levels**
1. **Assist**: Generate code snippets in comments
2. **Draft**: Create draft PR for human completion
3. **Implement**: Full implementation with tests
4. **Ship**: Auto-merge if all checks pass (opt-in)

### 4. Transparent Work Tracking

**Real-Time Progress Dashboard**
```markdown
## 🚀 Work Progress

**Status**: In Progress (2h 15m elapsed)
**Token Usage**: 780k / 2.4M (32.5%)

### 5. Intelligent Refund System

**Automated Refund Triggers**
```yaml
Refund Conditions:
  no_activity:
    days: 7
    refund: 100%
    
  work_blocked:
    reason: "Waiting on maintainer input"
    days: 14
    refund: "100% - tokens_used"
    
  scope_change:
    increase: ">50%"
    action: "Pause and request delta"
    
  abandoned:
    days: 30
    refund: "Prorated by work_completed"
```

**Fair Refund Calculation**
```typescript
function calculateRefund(funding: Funding): RefundAmount {
  const tokenCost = funding.tokensUsed * RATE_PER_MILLION;
  const timeCost = funding.hoursLogged * MAINTAINER_RATE;
  const platformFee = funding.amount * 0.10;
  
  const used = tokenCost + timeCost + platformFee;
  const refundable = Math.max(0, funding.amount - used);
  
  return {
    amount: refundable,
    breakdown: {
      original: funding.amount,
      tokensUsed: tokenCost,
      timeUsed: timeCost,
      fees: platformFee,
      refundable
    }
  };
}
```

## 📈 Estimation Deep Dive

### The Learning Estimation Engine

**Phase 1: Naive Heuristics (Days 1-30)**
```python
# Simple pattern matching
if "bug" in labels and changes_likely < 10:
    return "S"  # 1-3 hours
elif "feature" in labels:
    return "M"  # 4-8 hours
else:
    return "L"  # 8-16 hours
```

**Phase 2: Historical Correlation (Days 31-90)**
```python
# Learn from completed issues
similar_issues = find_similar(
    embedding=issue.vector,
    threshold=0.75
)

# Weight by recency and similarity
weighted_hours = sum(
    issue.actual_hours * similarity * recency_factor
    for issue, similarity in similar_issues
)

return weighted_hours * risk_multiplier
```

**Phase 3: Multi-Model Ensemble (Days 90+)**
```python
# Combine multiple prediction models
estimates = {
    'historical': historical_model.predict(issue),
    'complexity': complexity_analyzer.estimate(issue),
    'claude': await claude_estimate(issue),
    'maintainer': maintainer_override or None
}

# Weighted ensemble with confidence
final = weighted_average(
    estimates,
    weights=learned_weights,
    confidence=calculate_confidence(estimates)
)
```
